# Note: API route files (api/*.js) are NOT ignored because they're required by index.js
# They're Express routes, not separate Vercel functions, so they need to be included
# Only ignore the cron directory if it's not needed (but we need email-scheduler.js)
# api/cron/email-scheduler.js is needed for the cron endpoint
